The Cube of Knowledge
=====
---

Cube of Knowledge is an initiative to explore the possibilities of learning in a game environment.

The project purpose is to create a virtual environment based in Khan Academy which will provide the same experience but in an environment where the user actually interacts with the world.

The user will have to solve problems in order to advance to the next stage. In each stage the user will have the possibility to watch a video that will provide him the knowledge to solve the problem.

The main focus of the demo will be to teach basic math and physics.


#### The key technical points that we pretend to achieve:
* A basic engine based in WEBGL
* Multi-platform
